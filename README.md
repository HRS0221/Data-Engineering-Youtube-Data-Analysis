# AWS Data Engineering YouTube Data Analysis Project

# Project Accomplishments: Managing, Streamlining, and Analyzing Structured and Semi-structured YouTube Video Data

## Project Goals Achieved:
1. **Data Ingestion** — A mechanism was built to ingest data from different sources.
2. **ETL System** — Data in raw format was transformed into the proper format.
3. **Data Lake** — A centralized repository was established to store data from multiple sources.
4. **Scalability** — The system was ensured to scale with the increasing size of data.
5. **Cloud Integration** — AWS was utilized to process vast amounts of data efficiently.
6. **Reporting** — A dashboard was developed to obtain insights from the data.

## Services Utilized:
1. **Amazon S3** — Object storage service was employed, ensuring scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2. **AWS IAM** — Identity and access management was utilized to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
3. **QuickSight** — A scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service was implemented.
4. **AWS Glue** — A serverless data integration service was utilized to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
5. **AWS Lambda** — Computing service was used to run code without creating or managing servers.
6. **AWS Athena** — Interactive query service for S3 was employed, eliminating the need to load data as it stays in S3.

## Dataset Employed:
- The Kaggle dataset containing statistics (CSV files) on daily popular YouTube videos over many months has been utilized. Up to 200 trending videos published every day for many locations were analyzed. 
- The data for each region was stored in its own file. The video title, channel title, publication time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count were among the items included in the data. 
- A category_id field, differing by area, was also included in the JSON file linked to the region.
